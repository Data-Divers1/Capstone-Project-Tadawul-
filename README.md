Introduction:

      Data science is the field of applying advanced analytics techniques and scientific principles to extract valuable information from data for business decision-making, strategic planning and other uses. It's increasingly critical to businesses. The insights that data science generates help organizations increase operational efficiency, identify new business opportunities, and improve marketing and sales programs, among other benefits. Ultimately, they can lead to competitive advantages over business rivals.
      A stock exchange facilitates stockbrokers to trade company stocks and other securities. A stock may be bought or sold only if it is listed on an exchange. Thus, it is the meeting place of the stock buyers and sellers.
     This report shows the results and finding of analyzing Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) by leveraging data through exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and application of machine learning.
  

Business problem:

       The Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) is the sole entity authorized in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to act as the Securities Exchange. It is keen to provide new products and services that meet the needs of investors in addition to providing its users with the necessary resources and tools to become more capable investors.
       Tadawul is providing long-term growth plans for its group, and market participants with attractive and diversified investment opportunities, so it is always required to analyze and modeling its data for continuing its success and perfectly achieving its objectives, and to predict the change in the Saudi Stock.
Proposed solution
      The project will build different effective models to predict the change in trades number per day in two sectors of Saudi Stock Exchange, Real State and Energy. It will utilize the following Machine learning Algorithms:
  •	Linear Regression It is familiar algorithm in data science field for analyzing and manipulating data. It defined a linear relationship between a dependent variable and the other given independent variables.
  •	Decision Tree: It is a supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes, and leaf nodes.
  •	Random Forest: It is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.
  
  
Tadawul and Saudi's 2030 Vision:

      Vision 2030 is the overarching economic and social development strategy of the Kingdom. Its main themes are building a thriving economy, a vibrant society, and an ambitious nation, while one of its key pillars is for the Kingdom to become a global investment powerhouse.
      Vision 2030 has many specific goals and Tadawul’s activities interface with many of them including developing an advanced capital market, enabling financial institutions to support private sector growth, and promoting and enabling financial planning
      The primary goal of our project is to analyze Tadawul data and use an efficient Machine Learning model to predict future progress and develop professional suggestions for Tadawul that enable them to achieve 2030’s goals including:
  •	To raise the private sector’s contribution to GDP, from 40% to 65%.
  •	To increase the Public Investment Fund’s assets from SAR 600 Bn to over SAR 7 Tn.
  •	To rise from our current position of 25 to the top 10 countries on the Global Competitiveness Index.
  •	To move from our current position as the 19th largest economy in the world to the top 15.
  •	To increase the SME contribution to the GDP from 20% to 35%.
  
Aim and goals:

      The project aims to apply the learned skills from Data Science Bootcamp provided by SDA and Coding Dojo. It will build different predictive models of the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul) on two sectors, Real State and Energy by achieving the following goals: 
  •	Identifying significant attributes that increase trades number per day
  •	Prediction of the change of trades number per day based on its characteristics. 
  Scope
       The Financial Sector aims to develop in a diversified and effective to support the development of the national economy, diversify its sources of income, and stimulate savings, finances, and investments. The aim is to achieve this ambition by boosting financial sector institutions, and by developing the Saudi financial market to become an advanced capital market without weakening the financial sector's stability. Listed under the Financial Sector Development Program’s umbrella are several sub-sectors, including banking, insurance, investment, and stock and debt markets.

Dashboard:

A dashboard is a visual display of all data used to help track, analyze, and display data, usually to gain deeper insight into the overall wellbeing of the organization, a department, or even a specific process. It is primary intention is to provide information at-a-glance.
This project illustrates important insights through the dashboard, it uses different chart such as line chart, bar plot, pie chart, and others. 


Tools:

  The needed tools to satisfy the project requirements: 
  •	Environment: Jupyter Notebook.
  •	Programming Language: Python. 
  •	Data processing: Pandas, NumPy. 
  •	Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib, plotly.
  •	Modeling: Sickit-Learn. 
Also, Microsoft Power BI is used to build the project Dashboard.

Conclusion:

All in all, in this paper we applied the learned skills provided by SDA & Coding-dojo. we build different models to predict the number of trades per day of the two sectors in the Saudi Stock Exchange market and study the future progress of the stock market that will enable them to achieve the 2030 Vision.

Recommendations for future work: 

  1.	Build different models to get higher accuracy. 
  2.	Make a classification model to determine the best time to sell/buy stock in the market.
  3.	Try another target for the machine learning models.
  4.	Apply the study on other sectors.
